%------------------  DESCRIPTION -----------------%
priority_queue provides a minimal implementation of a 
priority queue for Matlab. The implementation can be used 
either inside MATLAB by means of MEX calls, or directly from a C/C++
program. The image on the website has been created with "pq_demo.m"

%------------------  FUNCTIONALITIES -----------------%
This implementation offers the following functionalities:  
- pq_create: 		        creates a priority queue
- pq_delete:		        frees the memory allocated
- pq_push:      		inserts a new element in the queue 
- pq_top:   			queries topmost element in the queue  
- pq_pop:           		retrieves and removes topmost element 
- pq_size:            		queries the queue size  

%------------------  FILE STRUCTURE -----------------%
Everyone of the scripts/functions is complete of the following:
*.cpp:      the mex implementation of the sources
*.m:        the comments that you can browse with the "help" command

%------------------  HOW COMPILE  -----------------%
IMPORTANT NOTE: I assume you have a correctly configured MEX environment.
You can compile directly inside MATLAB:
>> mex pq_create.cpp
>> mex pq_delete.cpp
>> % .... etc.
 
%------------------  DEVELOPMENT -----------------%
As mentioned the *.cpp files contain a MEX interface for MATLAB. 
- a C++ test/demo program is provided in pq_demo.cpp
- a MATLAB test/demo program is provided in pq_demo.m

%-------------- COMPATIBILITY NOTES --------------%
priority_queue compiles correctly with the following compilers:  
- i686-apple-darwin9-g++-4.0.1 (GCC) 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5484)
- Visual studio c++ 6.0 with Service pack 6
